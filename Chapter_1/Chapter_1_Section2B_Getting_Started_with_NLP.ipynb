      "      Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s wife, and all the rest of the\r\n",
      "      household, Dounia had a very hard time, especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov,\r\n",
      "      relapsing into his old regimental habits, was under the influence of\r\n",
      "      Bacchus. And how do you think it was all explained later on? Would you\r\n",
      "      believe that the crazy fellow had conceived a passion for Dounia from the\r\n",
      "      beginning, but had concealed it under a show of rudeness and contempt.\r\n",
      "      Possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his own flighty hopes,\r\n",
      "      considering his years and his being the father of a family; and that made\r\n",
      "      him angry with Dounia. And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and\r\n",
      "      sneering behaviour to hide the truth from others. But at last he lost all\r\n",
      "      control and had the face to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal,\r\n",
      "      promising her all sorts of inducements and offering, besides, to throw up\r\n",
      "      everything and take her to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can\r\n",
      "      imagine all she went through! To leave her situation at once was\r\n",
      "      impossible not only on account of the money debt, but also to spare the\r\n",
      "      feelings of Marfa Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and\r\n",
      "      then Dounia would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it\r\n",
      "      would have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\r\n",
      "      inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\r\n",
      "      not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\r\n",
      "      Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\r\n",
      "      has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\r\n",
      "      she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write to\r\n",
      "      me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were constantly\r\n",
      "      in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa Petrovna\r\n",
      "      accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the garden, and,\r\n",
      "      putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw the blame upon\r\n",
      "      her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful scene took place\r\n",
      "      between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to\r\n",
      "      strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was shouting at her for a\r\n",
      "      whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should be packed off at once\r\n",
      "      to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they flung all her things, her\r\n",
      "      linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing\r\n",
      "      it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dounia, insulted and put\r\n",
      "      to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an open cart all the seventeen\r\n",
      "      versts into town. Only think now what answer could I have sent to the\r\n",
      "      letter I received from you two months ago and what could I have written? I\r\n",
      "      was in despair; I dared not write to you the truth because you would have\r\n",
      "      been very unhappy, mortified and indignant, and yet what could you do? You\r\n",
      "      could only perhaps ruin yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it;\r\n",
      "      and fill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I\r\n",
      "      could not. For a whole month the town was full of gossip about this\r\n",
      "      scandal, and it came to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to\r\n",
      "      church on account of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks\r\n",
      "      made aloud about us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed\r\n",
      "      to us in the street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were\r\n",
      "      intending to insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house\r\n",
      "      with pitch, so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this\r\n",
      "      was set going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw\r\n",
      "      dirt at her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and\r\n",
      "      that month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is rather\r\n",
      "      talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly\r\n",
      "      of complaining to all and each of her husband—which is not at all\r\n",
      "      right—so in a short time she had spread her story not only in the\r\n",
      "      town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but Dounia\r\n",
      "      bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how she endured\r\n",
      "      it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is an angel! But by\r\n",
      "      God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr. Svidrigaïlov returned to\r\n",
      "      his senses and repented and, probably feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid\r\n",
      "      before Marfa Petrovna a complete and unmistakable proof of Dounia’s\r\n",
      "      innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia had been forced to write and\r\n",
      "      give to him, before Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden. This\r\n",
      "      letter, which remained in Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure,\r\n",
      "      she had written to refuse personal explanations and secret interviews, for\r\n",
      "      which he was entreating her. In that letter she reproached him with great\r\n",
      "      heat and indignation for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa\r\n",
      "      Petrovna, reminding him that he was the father and head of a family and\r\n",
      "      telling him how infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a\r\n",
      "      defenceless girl, unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter\r\n",
      "      was so nobly and touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to\r\n",
      "      this day I cannot read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the\r\n",
      "      servants, too, cleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a\r\n",
      "      great deal more than Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed—as indeed\r\n",
      "      is always the case with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken\r\n",
      "      aback, and ‘again crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was\r\n",
      "      completely convinced of Dounia’s innocence. The very next day, being\r\n",
      "      Sunday, she went straight to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with\r\n",
      "      tears to Our Lady to give her strength to bear this new trial and to do\r\n",
      "      her duty. Then she came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the\r\n",
      "      whole story, wept bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and\r\n",
      "      besought her to forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went\r\n",
      "      round to all the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she\r\n",
      "      asserted in the most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility\r\n",
      "      of her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\r\n",
      "      everyone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and\r\n",
      "      even allowed them to take copies of it—which I must say I think was\r\n",
      "      superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\r\n",
      "      the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\r\n",
      "      having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so that\r\n",
      "      in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone knew that\r\n",
      "      on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such\r\n",
      "      and such a place and people assembled for every reading of it, even many\r\n",
      "      who had heard it several times already both in their own houses and in\r\n",
      "      other people’s. In my opinion a great deal, a very great deal of all this\r\n",
      "      was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s character. Anyway she\r\n",
      "      succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’s reputation and the whole\r\n",
      "      ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace upon her husband,\r\n",
      "      as the only person to blame, so that I really began to feel sorry for him;\r\n",
      "      it was really treating the crazy fellow too harshly. Dounia was at once\r\n",
      "      asked to give lessons in several families, but she refused. All of a\r\n",
      "      sudden everyone began to treat her with marked respect and all this did\r\n",
      "      much to bring about the event by which, one may say, our whole fortunes\r\n",
      "      are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya, that Dounia has a suitor\r\n",
      "      and that she has already consented to marry him. I hasten to tell you all\r\n",
      "      about the matter, and though it has been arranged without asking your\r\n",
      "      consent, I think you will not be aggrieved with me or with your sister on\r\n",
      "      that account, for you will see that we could not wait and put off our\r\n",
      "      decision till we heard from you. And you could not have judged all the\r\n",
      "      facts without being on the spot. This was how it happened. He is already\r\n",
      "      of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly\r\n",
      "      related to Marfa Petrovna, who has been very active in bringing the match\r\n",
      "      about. It began with his expressing through her his desire to make our\r\n",
      "      acquaintance. He was properly received, drank coffee with us and the very\r\n",
      "      next day he sent us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer\r\n",
      "      and begged for a speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is\r\n",
      "      in a great hurry to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to\r\n",
      "      him. At first, of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all\r\n",
      "      happened so quickly and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the\r\n",
      "      whole day. He is a well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts\r\n",
      "      in the government and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is\r\n",
      "      forty-five years old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and\r\n",
      "      might still be thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very\r\n",
      "      respectable and presentable man, only he seems a little morose and\r\n",
      "      somewhat conceited. But possibly that may only be the impression he makes\r\n",
      "      at first sight. And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he\r\n",
      "      shortly will do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your\r\n",
      "      way is, if there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give\r\n",
      "      you this warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable\r\n",
      "      impression upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\r\n",
      "      deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\r\n",
      "      which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\r\n",
      "      Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man. At\r\n",
      "      his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but still\r\n",
      "      he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our most rising\r\n",
      "      generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He said a good deal\r\n",
      "      more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to, but\r\n",
      "      this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very little of it, but\r\n",
      "      Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man of great education, he\r\n",
      "      is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know your sister’s character,\r\n",
      "      Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and generous girl, but she has\r\n",
      "      a passionate heart, as I know very well. Of course, there is no great love\r\n",
      "      either on his side, or on hers, but Dounia is a clever girl and has the\r\n",
      "      heart of an angel, and will make it her duty to make her husband happy who\r\n",
      "      on his side will make her happiness his care. Of that we have no good\r\n",
      "      reason to doubt, though it must be admitted the matter has been arranged\r\n",
      "      in great haste. Besides he is a man of great prudence and he will see, to\r\n",
      "      be sure, of himself, that his own happiness will be the more secure, the\r\n",
      "      happier Dounia is with him. And as for some defects of character, for some\r\n",
      "      habits and even certain differences of opinion—which indeed are\r\n",
      "      inevitable even in the happiest marriages—Dounia has said that, as\r\n",
      "      regards all that, she relies on herself, that there is nothing to be\r\n",
      "      uneasy about, and that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only\r\n",
      "      their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He\r\n",
      "      struck me, for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well\r\n",
      "      come from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\r\n",
      "      instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent, in\r\n",
      "      the course of conversation, he declared that before making Dounia’s\r\n",
      "      acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of good reputation,\r\n",
      "      without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced poverty, because, as\r\n",
      "      he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his wife, but that it is\r\n",
      "      better for a wife to look upon her husband as her benefactor. I must add\r\n",
      "      that he expressed it more nicely and politely than I have done, for I have\r\n",
      "      forgotten his actual phrases and only remember the meaning. And, besides,\r\n",
      "      it was obviously not said of design, but slipped out in the heat of\r\n",
      "      conversation, so that he tried afterwards to correct himself and smooth it\r\n",
      "      over, but all the same it did strike me as somewhat rude, and I said so\r\n",
      "      afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was vexed, and answered that ‘words are\r\n",
      "      not deeds,’ and that, of course, is perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep\r\n",
      "      all night before she made up her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep,\r\n",
      "      she got out of bed and was walking up and down the room all night; at last\r\n",
      "      she knelt down before the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the\r\n",
      "      morning she told me that she had decided.\r\n",

      "      his wide, strong summer overcoat of some stout cotton material (his only\r\n",
      "      outer garment) and began sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside,\r\n",
